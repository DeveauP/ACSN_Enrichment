\section[Introduction]{Introduction}
Biological pathways and networks comprise sets of interactions or functional
relationships, occurring at the molecular level in living cells
\citep{adriaens2008public}.  A large body of knowledge on cellular biochemistry
is organized in publicly available repositories such as the KEGG database
\citep{kanehisa2011kegg}, Reactome \citep{croft2014reactome} and MINT
\citep{zanzoni2002mint}. All these biological databases facilitate a large
spectrum of analyses, improving our understanding of cellular systems. For
instance, it is a very common practice to cross the output of high-throughput
experiments, such as mRNA or protein expression levels, with curated biological
pathways in order to visualize changes, analyze their impact on a network and
formulate new hypotheses about biological processes. Many biologists and
computational biologists establish list of genes of interest (e.g. a list of
genes that are differentially expressed between two conditions, such as normal
vs disease) and then try to see if known biological pathways are enriched with
this list of genes. 

We have recently released the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), a
web-based database which describes signaling and regulatory molecular processes
that occur in a healthy mammalian cell but that are frequently deregulated
during cancerogenesis \citep{kuperstein2013navicell}.  The ACSN atlas aims to
be a comprehensive description of cancer-related mechanisms retrieved from the
most recent literature. The web interface for ACSN is using the NaviCell
technology, a software framework dedicated to web-based visualization and
navigation for biological pathway maps \citep{kuperstein2013navicell}. This
environment is providing an easy navigation of maps through the use of the
Google Maps JavaScript library, a community interface with a web blog system,
and a comprehensive module for visualization and analysis of high-throughput
data \citep{bonnet2015navicell}.



In this article, we describe two software packages related to ACSN analysis and
data visualization for the popular R statistical enrironment \citep{mainRref,
vance2009data}. The package \pkg{ACSNMineR} is designed for the calculation of
gene enrichment and depletion in ACSN maps, while \pkg{RNaviCell} is dedicated
to data visualization on ACSN maps. Both packages are available on the
Comprehensive R Archive Network
(\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ACSNMineR/} and
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNaviCell/}), and on the GitHub
repository (\url{https://github.com/sysbio-curie/ACSNMineR} and
\url{https://github.com/sysbio-curie/RNaviCell}).
