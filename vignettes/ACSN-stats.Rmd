Several statistical tests and options are available for the computation of enrichment or depletion of pathways.

### <a names = "FAssump"> Assumptions </a>

Fisher test assumes that observations are independant of one another and that row and column totals are fixed (i.e. "conditioned").
There is no a-priori to the distribution, however computation becomes difficult for large samples, chi-square and G tests of independance should be prefered in such cases.
