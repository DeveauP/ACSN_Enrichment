\section[Introduction]{Introduction}
Biological pathways and networks comprise sets of interactions or functional
relationships, occurring at the molecular level in living cells
\citep{adriaens2008public}.  A large body of knowledge on cellular biochemistry
is organized in publicly available repositories such as the KEGG database
\citep{kanehisa2011kegg}, Reactome \citep{croft2014reactome} and MINT
\citep{zanzoni2002mint}. All these biological databases facilitate a large
spectrum of analyses, improving our understanding of cellular systems. For
instance, it is a very common practice to cross the output of high-throughput
experiments, such as mRNA or protein expression levels, with curated biological
pathways in order to visualize changes, analyze their impact on a network and
formulate new hypotheses about biological processes. Many biologists and
computational biologists establish list of genes of interest (e.g. a list of
genes that are differentially expressed between two conditions, such as normal
vs disease) and then try to see if known biological pathways are enriched with
this list of genes. 

We have recently released the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), a
web-based database which describes signaling and regulatory molecular processes
that occur in a healthy mammalian cell but that are frequently deregulated
during cancerogenesis \citep{kuperstein2013navicell}.  The ACSN atlas aims to
be a comprehensive description of cancer-related mechanisms retrieved from the
most recent literature. The web interface for ACSN is using the NaviCell
technology, a software framework dedicated to web-based visualization and
navigation for biological pathway maps \citep{kuperstein2013navicell}. This
environment is providing an easy navigation of maps through the use of the
Google Maps JavaScript library, a community interface with a web blog system,
and a comprehensive module for visualization and analysis of high-throughput
data \citep{bonnet2015navicell}.


In this article, we describe two software packages related to ACSN analysis and
data visualization for the popular R statistical enrironment \citep{mainRref,
vance2009data}. The package \pkg{ACSNMineR} is designed for the calculation of
gene enrichment and depletion in ACSN maps, while \pkg{RNaviCell} is dedicated
to data visualization on ACSN maps. Both packages are available on the
Comprehensive R Archive Network
(\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ACSNMineR/} and
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNaviCell/}), and on the GitHub
repository (\url{https://github.com/sysbio-curie/ACSNMineR} and
\url{https://github.com/sysbio-curie/RNaviCell}). For the remainder of this
article, we describe the organization of each package and illustrate their
capacities with several concrete examples demonstrating their capabilities. 

\section[Package organization]{Packages organization}

\subsection{ACSNMineR}
Currently, ACSN maps covers signaling pathways involved in DNA repair, cell
cycle, cell survival, cell death, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
cell motility. Each of these large-scale molecular map is decomposed in a number
of functional modules. The maps themselves are merged into a global ACSN map.
Thus the information included in ACSN is organized in three hierarchical levels:
a global map, five individual maps, and a total of 55 functional modules. Each
ACSN map covers hundreds of molecular players, biochemical reactions and causal
relationships between the molecular players and cellular phenotypes.  ACSN
represents a large-scale biochemical reaction network of 4,826 reactions
involving 2,371 proteins, and is continuously updated and expanded.  We have
included the three hierarchical levels in the \pkg{ACSNMineR} package, in order
to be able to calculate enrichments at all three levels. The calculations are
made by counting the number of occurences of gene symbols (HUGO gene names) from
a given list of genes of interest in all ACSN maps and modules. Table
\ref{tab:table1} is detailling the number of gene symbols contained in all the ACSN
maps.


\begin{table}[h!]
 \centering
  \caption{ACSN maps included in the \pkg{ACSNMineR} package. Map: map name, Total: total
  number of gene symbols (HUGO), Nb mod.: number of modules, Min: mimimum
  number of gene symbols in the modules, Max: maximum number of gene symbols in
  the modules, Mean: average number of gene sybols per module. N.B.: one gene
  symbol may be present in several modules of the map.}
  \label{tab:table1}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c}
    \hline
    Map & Total & Nb mod. & Min & Max & Mean\\
    \hline
  ACSN global & 2137 & 55 & 2 &625& 85\\
  Survival  &1065&46  &1 &434 &54\\
  Apoptosis & 668&44 & 1& 382& 33\\
  EMT \& Cell motility &620 &41  &1 &615 &43\\
  DNA repair &337&48  &1 &69  &19\\
  Cell cycle &119&45  &1 &27  &8\\
  \hline

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}


The statistical significance of the counts in the modules is assessed by using
either the Fisher exact test \citep{fisher1922interpretation,
fisher1934statistical} or the hypergeometric test, which are equivalent for this
purpose \cite{rivals2007enrichment}.

The current ACSN maps are included in the \pkg{ACSNMineR} package, as a list of character matrices.

\begin{verbatim}
> length(ACSN_maps)
[1] 6
> names(ACSN_maps)
[1] "Apoptosis"    "CellCycle"    "DNA_repair"   "EMT_motility" "ACSN_master" 
[6] "Survival"    
\end{verbatim}

For each matrix, rows represent a module, with the name of the module in the
first column, followed by a description of the module (optional), and then
followed by all the gene symbols of the module. The maps will be updated
according to every ACSN major release.

The main function of the \pkg{ACSNMineR} package is the \code{enrichment}
function, which is calculating over-representation or depletion of genes in the
ACSN maps and modules.
